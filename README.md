# Learning about inheritence_and_composition


Inheritance and composition are both important concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a programming paradigm that focuses on creating objects that have specific attributes and behaviors.

Inheritance allows objects to inherit attributes and methods from a parent class. This means that you can create a new class that has all the same attributes and methods as an existing class, and then add or modify them as needed. Inheritance is often used to create classes that are related to each other in some way, such as a parent class that defines a basic set of attributes and methods, and then child classes that build on that foundation to add more specific functionality.

Composition, on the other hand, involves combining multiple objects to create a new object that has a specific set of attributes and behaviors. This is done by creating objects of different classes and then combining them in various ways. For example, you might create a class for a car, and then compose it with classes for an engine, wheels, and a transmission to create a complete car object.

In summary, inheritance and composition are both powerful tools in OOP that allow you to create complex and flexible systems by building on existing objects and combining them in new ways.
